# ECC for Codex CLI

This supplements the root `AGENTS.md` with a repo-local ECC baseline.

## Repo Skill

- Repo-generated Codex skill: `.agents/skills/fullstack-garage/SKILL.md`
- Claude-facing companion skill: `.claude/skills/fullstack-garage/SKILL.md`
- Keep user-specific credentials and private MCPs in `~/.codex/config.toml`, not in this repo.

## MCP Baseline

Treat `.codex/config.toml` as the default ECC-safe baseline for work in this repository.
The generated baseline enables GitHub, Context7, Exa, Memory, Playwright, and Sequential Thinking.

## Multi-Agent Support

- Explorer: read-only evidence gathering
- Reviewer: correctness, security, and regression review
- Docs researcher: API and release-note verification
- Feature orchestrator: planning, approval, implementation, review, and fix-loop coordination
- Feature planner: requirement clarification and dependency-aware task breakdowns
- Feature worker: one bounded implementation or fix task with fresh context
- Feature reviewer: feature correctness, risk, maintainability, and overengineering review

## Feature Delivery Workflow

- Canonical workflow: `.agents/skills/orchestrate-feature/SKILL.md`
- Use `feature-orchestrator` for end-to-end feature delivery; specialist feature agents require its approved-plan handoff.
